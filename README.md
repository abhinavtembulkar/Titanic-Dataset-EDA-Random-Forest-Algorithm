# Titanic-Dataset-EDA-Random-Forest-Algorithm
This is a small ML project on the Titanic dataset. The aim of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis on the data with the help of graphs, processing the data and finally applying the Random Forest algorithm to predict the survival based on the features.

The data has been split into two groups:

training set (train.csv)
test set (test.csv)

The training set has been used to build machine learning models. 

The test set has been used to see how well the model performs on unseen data. For each passenger in the test set, we use the model trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.
